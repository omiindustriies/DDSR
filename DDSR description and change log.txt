There are two different versions of the Dual Digital Shift Register. The older version, which is only available as a DIY kit has some differences from the newer retail version. The original version, designed by Naomi Mitchell with the aid of Robert Smith, uses bipolar signals on the outputs. The gates and CV outputs range from -5/+5. The newer version, done by Naomi, has all unipolar outputs, with the gates having an output range of 0-5v. Channel A has an output range of ~0-3v and Channel B has a range of ~0-4v.
